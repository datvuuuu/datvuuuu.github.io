					<b><p>How do I get there ?</p></b>
					<p>The easiest way to get to the meeting point is via Oslo Gardermoen airport (OSL code). From there, you fly to Harstad/Narvik Evenes airport (EVE code). Domestic flights in Norway can be purchased from www.sas.no, www.norwegian.no </p>
					<b><p>What level of photography is required ?</p></b>
					<p>All of ours tours, workshops and masterclasses are open to beginners as well as professionals. Our only criteria is that you have a great passion for photography, and have the energy and motivation to be on the go every day and night.</p>
					<b><p>What should I bring ?</p></b>
					<p>Since we are exploring the high arctic and northern Norway archipelago’s, you have to be well equipped for all kinds of dramatic weather including rainfall. Bring comfortable, warm and waterproof outer layers such as Gore-tex, thermal underwear, crampons and water resistant boots or even waders. A complete list of recommended clothes as well as camera gear will be provided upon registration. We don’t have clothes or shoes available for renting.</p>
					<b><p>Will I experience snow or ice ?</p></b>
					<p>Most likely yes. February is the month with most snow and we hope for tons of snow and ice!</p>
					<b><p>Will I see and photograph the Northern lights?</p></b>
					<p>Yes, most likely. February is one of the best times to see and photograph the northern lights.</p>
					<b><p>What kind of weather can I expect ?</p></b>
					<p>The weather and climate in northern Norway is renowned for being extremely unpredictable because of it’s many local weather systems. This means conditions can change within minutes and kilometres, also resulting in very dramatic light and photographic opportunities. Lofoten has a much milder climate than other parts of the world at a similar latitude, such as Greenland and Alaska. This is due to the temperature of the water of the Gulfstream. The coastal climate results in mild winters and cool summer temperatures. Traditionally, January and February are the coldest months with an average temperature of -1 degrees celsius. </p>
